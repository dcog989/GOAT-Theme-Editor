## Usage

The app is entirely contained in the HTML, so either [open the HTML](https://rawcdn.githack.com/dcog989/GOAT-Theme-Editor/8ae8946a2e10f9bb1e0dc8a09e9728d4f8601d94/Goat%20Theme%20Editor.html) to use it, or [view the HTML](https://github.com/dcog989/GOAT-Theme-Editor/blob/main/Goat%20Theme%20Editor.html) then save to use it locally.

Tested on [Ditto Clipboard Manager](https://github.com/sabrogden/Ditto/), and [Notepad++](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus). All good from my testing, but would recommend checking output with [WinMerge](https://github.com/WinMerge/winmerge).
